# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Linked List is a linear data structure. It is a series of connected "nodes" that contains the "address" of the next node. Each node can store a data point which may be a number, a string or any other type of data.


***A singly linked list*** is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).
## Challenge
***Description of the challenge***

Create a Node classs and LinkedList class that will have a singly linked list properties like adding element to the beginning of the linked list, check for the existence of the elemnt in the list and print all list elements as a string 


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
This is the complexity for time and space for each method requird in the Task

**insert**:
  time complexity : O(1)
,space complexity: O(1)


**includes** :
 time complexity : O(n)
,space complexity: O(1)


**to string**:
 time complexity : O(n)
,space complexity: O(1)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

The class should contain the following methods

***insert***
Arguments: value

Returns: nothing

Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

###############

***includes***

Arguments: value

Returns: Boolean

Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

###############

***to string***

Arguments: none

Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"
