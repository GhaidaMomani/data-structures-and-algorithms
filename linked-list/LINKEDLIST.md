**Linked List** is a linear data structure. It is a series of connected "nodes" that contains the "address" of the next node. Each node can store a data point which may be a number, a string or any other type of data.


***A singly linked list*** is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).
